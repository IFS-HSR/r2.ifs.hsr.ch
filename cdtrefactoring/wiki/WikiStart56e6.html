Welcome to the CDT Refactoring project website. We are developing a C++ Refactoring Plug-in for [http://www.eclipse.org/cdt/ CDT]. 

{{{

<strong><span style="color: #FF0000;">Please note that this project is no longer active.</span></strong> Most of the refactorings are now part of the regular Eclipse CDT distribution and require not separate installation. If you want to track our latest developments, please take a look at our <a href="http://cute-test.com/">CUTE project</a>.
}}}

After the realization of one term project and two diploma theses and a lot of work we finally have a plug-in which provides the following refactorings:

 * Declare Method
 * Extract Baseclass
 * Extract Constant
 * Extract Method
 * Extract Subclass
 * Hide Method
 * [wiki:ImplementMethod Implement Method]
 * Move Field / Method
 * Replace Number
 * Separate Class
 * [wiki:GenerateGettersAndSetters Generate Getters and Setters]

If you have any wishes, don't hesitate to contact us. We are also '''looking for sponsors''', please contact [mailto:psommerl@hsr.ch Peter Sommerlad] if you'd like to support our work.
