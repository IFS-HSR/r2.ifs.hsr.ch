= CUTE C++ Unit Testing Framework =

CUTE is an easy to use C++ unit testing framework that leverages modern C++ libraries and features.  CUTE is orthogonal, easily extendable and much simpler than other C++ unit testing approaches like CPPUnit.  For example, CUTE does not require that you write a derived class for each C++ class you want to unit test.

The CUTE Eclipse plug-in integrates CUTE into the [http://www.eclipse.org/cdt/ Eclipse CDT C/C++ integrated development environment]. The plug-in provides all the important features that Java developers know from the JUnit plug-in, like wizards, test navigator, and a diff viewer for analyzing failed tests.

CUTE stands for ''C++ Unit Testing Easier''.  CUTE was developed by [http://wiki.hsr.ch/PeterSommerlad Professor Peter Sommerlad] of the [http://www.ifs.hsr.ch/ Institute for Software] (IFS).
