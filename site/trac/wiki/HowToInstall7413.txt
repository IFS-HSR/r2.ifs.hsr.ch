The refactorings from Aptana's RDT distribution are broken and we don't know yet when they'll get fixed. In the meantime, you can install them from our [http://ifs.hsr.ch/rubyrefactoring/updatesite/ updatesite] (ours have a higher version number and will replace Aptana's).


If you encounter any bugs (which I'm sure exist) or have feature requests, do not hesitate to [http://r2.ifs.hsr.ch/trac/newticket create a ticket] or drop [mailto:me@misto.ch me] an email.
