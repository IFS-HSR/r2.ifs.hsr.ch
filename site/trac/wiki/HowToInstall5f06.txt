The refactorings from Aptana's RDT distribution are broken and we don't know yet when they'll get fixed. In the meantime, you can install them from our [http://ifs.hsr.ch/rubyrefactoring/updatesite/ updatesite] (ours have a higher version number and will replace Aptana's).


If you encounter any bugs (which I'm sure exist) or have feature requests, do not hesitate to [http://r2.ifs.hsr.ch/trac/newticket create a ticket] or drop [mailto:me@misto.ch me] an email.

=== Windows Users ===

Windows users should change their line delimiter character in Eclipse to 'unix', otherwise you might get funny results from the refactorings. This can be done in the preferences page under ''General -> Workspace -> New Text File Line Delimiter'' (or see the attached screenshot). We hope we can fix this issue in a later version.
