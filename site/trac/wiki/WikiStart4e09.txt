= Welcome to the Ruby Refactoring Wiki =

This is the website of our project to bring refactoring support to RDT. 

We recommend to read our [http://r2.ifs.hsr.ch/rubyrefactoring.pdf report] (~3MB PDF) to get an overview to the things we did. If you have any feedback, please drop an email! Due to a lot of spam, we had to make the wiki read-only, but you can still create tickets anonymously.

We also have some '''[http://r2.ifsoftware.ch/cgi-bin/awstats.pl statistics]''' for the webserver, repository statistics can be found [http://r2.ifs.hsr.ch/svnstats here].

Our progress can be followed by looking at [http://r2.ifsoftware.ch/trac/report/6 this report], which shows you our milestoned, including closed ones.
