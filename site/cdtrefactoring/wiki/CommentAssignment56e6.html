= Comment Handling Ideas =

== Proxies ==
 * (Visitor) Own traversal mechanism
 * Creation of a new AST
 * Each node gets a clone with comment capabilities
 * Indirection when accessing
 * Own Visitor Strategy


== JIT Comment Assignment ==
 * For every node where a comment would be interesting the comment list is searched for matching comments
 * Visitor for assignment
 * Bad Scaling


== Node Factory for AST Generation ==
 * Change in CDT - Factory for Nodes while AST generation
 * Node Factory for Commented Nodes
  * Extention of ASTNode
  * Implementation of own structure
 * Direct assignment and access to comments in nodes


== Comment Hash Map ==
 * Map with nodes as key and a list of comments as value
 * Created by a visitor before refactoring
 * Dynamic comment determination when needed

== Build Our Own Code Model ==
 * Visit the AST and create a separate model of the code, which we could then augment with more information, like comments
  * - lots of duplication and rewriting :(
  * + we can do whatever we want with it, like moving functionality from the countless helper classes into the model. :)
