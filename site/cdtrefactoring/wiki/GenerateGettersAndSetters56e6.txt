What we need:
 * Tree of all members with getter and setter children (where applicable). Should show real names, live preview.
 * Configure style: `getXyz()` or `xyz()`
 * Implement in header, cpp
 * Always pass as `const &`
 * Getters are `const`
 * Access modifiers
 * 4 buttons to select ~~all~~, none, all of a kind
 * option to filter `m_` and `_`

Nice to have:
 * Insertion point
 * booleans use `isXyz`
 * static getters and setter *urgh*
